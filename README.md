# Altyz
## Why Altyz?
I have used many subtitle editors to edit subtitles for videos (that are already created). Some of these subtitle editors are HappyScribe, Clideo, Veed.io.

But I didn't have the patience for the web app to load and all that. On top of that, I wanted to use my keyboard mainly. I didn't want to use mouse to click some icons. I felt it was not fast enough. Since I create subtitles for videos from time to time, I always wondered how efficient I can make this workflow.

Using shortcuts I can make the workflow much quicker. I would never have to use the mouse again. For every task: creating , trimming, moving, editing, deleting subtitle blocks, I thought of a simple shortcut/shortcut combination.

That's what led me to develop this small app. In Altyz, the work is done mainly using shortcuts. You have shortcut for literally anything.

## Features
- Live preview of the video while editing the subtitles.
- Simple timeline showing the video duration and subtitle blocks.\
- Resizable/Moveable subtitle blocks within the timeline.
- Upload (or open) existing subtitle file. The subtitles will get populated in the timeline.
- Zoom feature for the timeline.
- Export Subitle files as .srt
- Shortcuts to make the subtitle editing easier and faster.

## Shortcuts

- Delete Subtitle Block: DEL key.
